The name is made up. Credentials: _Azure, Purgatory, and all the lost hours trying to figure out

 * Can not log out? 
 * Can you not add an account?
 * Do your `az login` commands end up with errors referring to other accounts?
 * nom nom nom
‚Ä¶then this script is for you.

## Prerequisites

Only the [Azure az CLI tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?view=azure-cli-latest).

## How does it work?

The following steps have been reliable so far.

1. Performs log out of current az login via Azure CLI tool
1. Purges cache using Azure CLI tool
1. Removes JSON sls token cache from the Azure dir in current users home dir
1. Removes JSON access token cache from the Azure dir in current users home dir
1. Removes JSON profile cache from the Azure dir in current users home dir
1. Performs log in using Azure CLI tool
